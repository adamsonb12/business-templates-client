.materialUiElement {
    padding: 0 1em 1em !important;
    width: 100%;
}

// TODO => Change existing forms to just use the material UI elements, will be easier to keep it all the same in the future and for others to maintain if necessary => will need to integrate with our own css, will be a lot of tedious work
